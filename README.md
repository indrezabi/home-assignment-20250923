# Data Quality Analysis

## Task

The goal of the task is to find hidden insights in the data, prepare dashboards and present the findings backed up by arguments of potential ways to improve the quality of the data highlighting potential bottlenecks and failure of services.

## Workflow Summary

- **Data download** from AWS access  
- **Python (Google Colab)** used for inspection, cleaning, and enrichment. Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z7b6UJZb0glY0I2ThFn6iDY8MSU0Un9V?usp=sharing 
- **CSV export** of cleaned data  
- **Looker Studio dashboard** built for final analysis and visualization. Link: https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/a2b9684c-1f70-4499-aa93-029c4e8418c6 
- **Conclusions, recommendations, and further ideas** presented directly in the dashboard

## Important Notes

❗️To run the Colab notebook, manually upload the original data files provided by Nord Security.  
Due to size limits, files were imported from local storage (not cloud).

❗️Looker report defaults to data from 2015 onward, to exclude legacy records and prevent outdated entries (e.g., from 1936, etc) from skewing the analysis.
